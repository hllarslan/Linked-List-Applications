# Linked-List-Applications
I am currently working on logic behind linked list. For this reason I know that pointers are vital not only for linked list but also for whole C  language world. 

First of all, I try to complete my assignment, my assignment is that I need to get sentence from user it does not matter either by character or string and then user enter word to remove from sentence. I am now beginner both C and Github.


My algorithm

1- Get sentence 
2- Apply it by using linked list
3- Get word to delete
4- Print new sentence and display it
